Question
Implement an algorithm to determine if the string has all unique characters

  Approach1:
  Use Hash table to map each character and return false when you find the key already present in the hashtable
  Time Complexity O(n)
  Space Complexity O(n)
  
  or of the characters are ASCII 128 then just create an array of 128 elements and map them
  
  Approach 2:
  -Sort the array and then traverse to find two consecutive elements which are same
  
  Approach 3:
  Using Bit Vector
  Here we can reduce the space by a margin of 8 in the approach 1
  we traverse through the array and find the value of (char - 'a') and then set (char - 'a')th bit as 1 by ORing with a variable.
  And we use a condition when anding a new character is more than 1 then we found a duplicate
  
  code:
  
  boolean isUniqueChar(string str)
  {
  
    inte chacker=0;
    for (int i=0;i<str.size();i++)
    {
      int val=str[i]-'a';
      
      if(checker & (1<<val) > 0)  // checking if bit at position val is set if yes then we know that the current char is duplicate
        return false;
        
      checker = checker || 1<<val ;    //set the nth bit by ORing
    }
    
    return true;
    
  
  }
